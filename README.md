# EyeMovement
## Follows the mouse pointer...   
Use document.onmousemove to locate the pointer...   
  Once you open this item in the brouser the eyes should follow your mouse pointer.
## Future improvements, I've been thinking of adding color to the eyes and a second circle in the middle with a picture.
